# Help Nearby

Help Nearby is a standalone public resource hub designed to reduce barriers, confusion, and wasted effort by helping people explore what types of assistance may be relevant to their situation and where to go next.

This project is **informational only**. It does not collect applications, store personal data, determine eligibility, or distribute aid.

## Purpose

People seeking help often face fragmented, overwhelming information. Many assistance programs go underutilized while individuals struggle to understand what exists or where to start.

Help Nearby exists to:
- clarify what kinds of assistance programs exist
- explain program categories in plain language
- guide people toward appropriate starting points
- route users to official resources and application sites
- reduce wasted time, energy, and effort
